Reflection
	In this workshop, we implemented and utilized a functor as well as defining a lambda expression. The main difference between the two is that a lambda will be need to looped in a code for it to loop. Usually lambda’s are used when the programmer isn’t going to reuse the functor or will use it but from a different code in a different header file. In the Movie and Book classes, I believe that default constructors are necessary because we have one-arg constructors defined. Without default constructors defined, the program will not run and an error will be given. Default constructors are usually generated by the compiler if one is not defined AND if no other user-defined constructors are defined. In this case, if we didn’t have the one-arg constructors, we wouldn’t need to define the default constructors. Because these two modules are very similar, I believe it will be more efficient to create one module instead. There will have to be a lot of ‘if’ conditions in the functions or we can use a switch case where if a book title is entered, a book will appear, etc.
